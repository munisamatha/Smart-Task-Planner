# Smart-Task-Planner
A simple yet powerful web application that takes a high-level goal and breaks it down into an actionable, step-by-step plan. This project uses a FastAPI backend and can leverage OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent task decomposition, with a reliable local fallback method.

Automatically breaks down complex goals (e.g., "Launch a new product in 3 months") into a structured task list.
